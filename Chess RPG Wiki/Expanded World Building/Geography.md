# Geography

Grand Chess Realms spans diverse terrain reflecting factional ideologies through environmental character—[White Kingdom's](../Factions/White Kingdom.md) fertile valleys and coastal access contrasting with [Black Kingdom's](../Factions/Black Kingdom.md) mountainous frontiers and harsh northern territories. Geography shapes culture, resources, and military strategy, creating environmental storytelling opportunities where terrain itself becomes narrative element.

## Overview: A Divided Realm

Chess Realms' geography derives from [The Bisection War](../Historical Events/The Bisection War.md) approximately 400 years ago—cataclysmic conflict magically dividing unified kingdom into opposing territories. The division wasn't arbitrary geographical partition but reflected underlying ideological fault lines, with each faction claiming territories aligning with cultural values and strategic requirements.

**Central Contested Zone**: Border regions including [Dragon's Sicilian Range](../Geography/Dragon_s Sicilian Range.md) and surrounding territories remain perpetually contested—neither faction achieves permanent control, creating buffer separating kingdoms while providing staging areas for military operations.

**Neutral Territories**: [Knightfall City](../Geography/Knightfall City.md), [Greyhaven](../Geography/Greyhaven.md), [FourSquares](../Geography/FourSquares.md), and [Enchanted Forest](../Geography/Enchanted Forest.md) maintain independence through geographic defensibility, political maneuvering, or mystical protection enabling self-governance despite surrounding factional pressures.

**Coastal Maritime** (Port Crown's Reach region): Mild temperatures, frequent fog and rain. Maritime influence moderates temperature extremes creating favorable conditions year-round.

**Alpine/Subalpine** (Mountain regions): Harsh winters, short growing seasons, extreme temperature variations. Challenging environment requiring specialized adaptations yet providing defensive advantages through difficult terrain.

**Northern Continental** (Frostmarches): Severe winters, brief summers, permafrost in extreme north. Only hardy populations including [orcish](../Races/Orcs.md) communities thrive permanently.

### Major Rivers and Waterways

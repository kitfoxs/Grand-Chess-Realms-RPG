# Starter Adventure: Pieces in Play

**Adventure Length**: 2-4 sessions
**Recommended For**: New players learning chess and RPG systems
**Starting Location**: Quiet village in [White Kingdom](../Factions/White Kingdom.md) near [Queen's Gambit Valley](../Geography/Queen_s Gambit Valley.md)

## Introduction & Setup

Players begin as aspiring chess players in peaceful farming village—characters might be local youth seeking adventure, traveling merchants, or refugees from border conflicts seeking new start. Village elder recognizes potential, offering basic chess instruction while local situations provide low-stakes practice before larger adventures begin.

### Character Creation Guidance

New players should create characters reflecting their current chess skill—beginners might roleplay enthusiastic students, intermediate players could be traveling competitors, and advanced players might portray experienced warriors passing through. This alignment prevents frustration when player skill and character concept diverge significantly.

## Act 1: A Training Match (Session 1)

### The Village Elder's Lesson

**NPC: Elder Thomlin** (Human, Age 67, Elo 1400)
Retired knight teaching village youth chess fundamentals—kind mentor recognizing that strategic thinking serves life beyond warfare. Provides tutorial explaining:

- **Basic Rules**: Piece movement, check, checkmate, castling, en passant
- **Opening Principles**: Control center, develop pieces, king safety
- **Fundamental Tactics**: Forks, pins, skewers demonstrated through positions
- **First Match**: Friendly game against Elder Thomlin (can provide hints and move suggestions appropriate to teaching context)

**Roleplay Elements**: Village tour introducing NPCs, local customs, and establishing comfortable environment before challenges arise.

**Dice Usage**: Social checks building relationships with villagers, investigation discovering local chess history and traditions.

### Tutorial Chess Match

**Time Control**: No clock (casual learning environment)
**Narrative Context**: Annual village tradition where elder tests promising students
**Outcome Flexibility**: Winning earns elder's praise; losing gracefully teaches sportsmanship and provides feedback for improvement. Either outcome advances story.

## Act 2: The Bandit Challenge (Session 1-2)

### Crisis Arrives

**NPC: "Rook" Garrett** (Human, Age 32, Elo 1500)
Disgraced former soldier turned bandit—believes strength justifies taking what weak cannot defend. Challenges village champion to chess match: victory grants him supplies and lodging without resistance, defeat forces withdrawal.

**Bandit Motivation**: Not pure evil—desperate circumstances following military discharge, struggling survival through rural banditry while maintaining personal code prohibiting violence against children. Morally complex antagonist rather than simple villain.

**Stakes**: First real consequences—village needs supplies for coming winter, elder too old for competitive match, responsibility falls to players.

### Preparation Montage

**Investigation**: Dice rolls gathering information about Garrett's playing style from travelers who encountered him previously
**Training**: Elder Thomlin provides intensive preparation focusing on tactical patterns
**Social Choices**: Players might attempt negotiating alternative solutions (persuasion checks) or gathering village support
**Equipment**: Villagers contribute quality chess set and lucky charm (narrative confidence boost)

### The Duel

**Time Control**: 60+30 (first timed match—introducing time pressure)
**Narrative Elements**: Village gathering as spectators, elder providing moral support, atmospheric tension
**Tactics Hint**: Elder whispers about Garrett favoring aggressive attacks leaving king exposed—subtle guidance without direct interference
**Outcome Variations**:
- **Victory**: Garrett honors agreement, departs peacefully, possibly respects players enough for future non-hostile encounter
- **Loss**: Elder negotiates reduced tribute, village survives but strained. Players learn from defeat, motivated for improvement

### Post-Match Consequences

Win or lose, bandit crisis attracts attention from [White Kingdom](../Factions/White Kingdom.md) authorities investigating regional stability. This provides transition to broader campaign world.

## Act 3: First Contact with Black Kingdom (Session 2-3)

### The Ambassador Arrives

**NPC: Ambassador Corvus** ([Black Kingdom](../Factions/Black Kingdom.md), Human, Age 41, Elo 1650)
Diplomatic envoy investigating border region stability—impressed by players' handling of bandit situation regardless of outcome. Offers recruitment opportunity presenting [Black Kingdom](../Factions/Black Kingdom.md) perspective.

**Key Conversation Topics**:
- **Meritocracy Appeal**: "Your skill determined outcome—not birth, not wealth, but capability. This principle guides our kingdom."
- **Perspective Challenge**: "White Kingdom calls us ambitious—we call them stagnant. Both narratives contain truth yet incomplete pictures."
- **No Pressure**: "I merely present opportunity. Whether you serve White Kingdom loyalty, join Black Kingdom, or maintain independence remains your choice. We value free will—forced loyalty proves unreliable."

**Roleplay Opportunity**: First major political decision shaping campaign direction. No "wrong" choice—each path offers unique opportunities and challenges.

### Decision Point

Players don't immediately join factions—Ambassador Corvus provides contact information, invitations to visit [The Obsidian Throne](../Geography/The Obsidian Throne.md), and open-ended offer allowing players deciding later. Meanwhile, [White Kingdom](../Factions/White Kingdom.md) representatives arrive investigating bandit incident, providing counterpoint perspective.

**Elder Thomlin's Wisdom**: "Both kingdoms contain honorable individuals and corrupt officials. Faction allegiance matters less than personal integrity. Choose based on values rather than propaganda from either side."

## Optional Side Quests

### The Lost Tome Fragment

**Objective**: Discover old manuscript fragment in village archives mentioning [Lost Tomes](../Mythology and Magic/Lost Tomes.md)
**Activities**: Research checks, interviewing elderly villagers, exploring abandoned chapel
**Rewards**: Introduction to prophecy themes, item providing narrative advantage in future lore checks
**Connection**: Seeds interest in "Lost Tome of Caissa" major campaign

### The Pawn's Rebellion

**Situation**: Village farmers question economic exploitation—feel treated as expendable "pawns" supporting noble aristocrats
**Complexity**: Legitimate grievances yet rebellion risks violent crackdown. Players mediate between frustrated farmers and defensive authorities
**Outcomes**:
- Support rebellion: Gains commoner gratitude but factional suspicion
- Maintain status quo: Gains authority approval but commoner resentment
- Mediate compromise: Difficult (requires high social checks) but potentially satisfies both sides
**Theme**: Introduction to political complexities beyond simple good/evil dichotomy

### The Village Tournament

**Format**: Casual 4-player Swiss tournament against local NPCs (Elo 1200-1500)
**Purpose**: Additional chess practice in low-stakes friendly environment
**Social Element**: Building relationships with villagers through shared competition
**Prize**: Modest funds, quality chess set, or invitation to regional tournament
**Optional**: Can run as actual mini-tournament with other player characters if campaign has multiple players

## Conclusion & Transition

**Recommended Practice**: Balance chess improvement (15-30 minutes daily tactical puzzles), campaign preparation (reviewing world notes, planning NPC motivations), and actual gameplay sessions. Chess skills develop gradually—consistent practice matters more than intensive cramming.

**Community Engagement**: Consider joining online communities playing chess while roleplaying characters, or organizing local groups combining interests.

**Keep Learning**: Chess improvement is lifelong journey—even grandmasters continue studying. Similarly, RPG storytelling develops through practice, experimentation, and learning from successful sessions and mistakes alike.

# Glossary of Terms

## Chess Terminology

### Algebraic Notation
Standard system recording chess moves—files labeled a-h (left to right), ranks numbered 1-8 (bottom to top from White's perspective). Example: "e4" means pawn moves to e4 square; "Nf3" means knight moves to f3.

### Blunder
Serious mistake losing material or positional advantage—often game-deciding error distinguishing levels of play.

### Castling
Special king-rook move enabling king safety: O-O (kingside), O-O-O (queenside). King moves two squares toward rook, rook jumps to opposite side. Cannot castle if king has moved, through check, or if squares between are attacked.

### Check
King under direct attack—must immediately respond by moving king, blocking attack, or capturing attacking piece.

### Checkmate (Mate)
King under attack with no legal escape—game ends, attacking player wins.

### En Passant
Special pawn capture rule: when opponent's pawn advances two squares from starting position landing beside your pawn, you may capture it as if it had moved only one square. Must execute immediately or lose opportunity.

### Fianchetto
Strategic bishop development to long diagonal (b2, g2 for White; b7, g7 for Black)—typically preceded by pawn moves creating diagonal. Common in King's Indian, Sicilian Dragon, and similar openings.

### Fork
Tactical pattern where single piece simultaneously attacks multiple enemy pieces—typically forcing opponent choosing which piece to save.

### Gambit
Opening strategy sacrificing material (usually pawn) for positional compensation—rapid development, attacking chances, or initiative. Examples: King's Gambit, Queen's Gambit, Danish Gambit.

### Pin
Tactical pattern where piece cannot move without exposing more valuable piece behind it—absolute pin (against king) prevents movement legally; relative pin creates practical restriction.

### Skewer
Tactical pattern attacking valuable piece forcing it moving, exposing less valuable piece behind it—reverse pin.

### Stalemate
Position where player has no legal moves yet king isn't in check—game ends in draw regardless of material balance.

### Tempo
Unit of time measured in moves—gaining tempo means achieving position while opponent wastes time; losing tempo means requiring extra moves accomplishing same goal.

### Zugzwang
Position where any move worsens situation—player would prefer passing turn but must move. Common in endgames where king movements prove disadvantageous.

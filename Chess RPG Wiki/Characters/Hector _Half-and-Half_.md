Independent mercenary

Half-Orc, Half-Human, Age 27

## Description

Hector's mixed heritage positioned him awkwardly between cultures—[human](../Races/Humans.md) communities viewing him as too [orcish](../Races/Orcs.md) for full acceptance, while [orcish](../Races/Orcs.md) tribes considered him insufficiently committed to warrior traditions that pure-blood lineages maintain. This marginal status forced self-reliance: neither community provided institutional support that members receive automatically, requiring him building reputation through demonstrated capability rather than inherited standing. Mercenary work offered path where performance determines success regardless of ancestry—clients caring primarily whether contracts get fulfilled rather than evaluating pedigree that factional prejudices emphasize.

His combat effectiveness combines [orcish](../Races/Orcs.md) physical strength with [human](../Races/Humans.md) tactical flexibility—he possesses raw power that smaller humans cannot match yet also analytical thinking that purely instinctive orcish berserker approaches overlook. This hybrid capability makes him valuable for assignments requiring versatility that specialists cannot provide. Yet Hector recognizes mercenary success provides financial security without addressing deeper belonging needs—he dreams that demonstrating how mixed heritage produces advantages might eventually shift prejudices, proving that cooperation between [humans](../Races/Humans.md) and [orcs](../Races/Orcs.md) yields benefits exceeding what separation achieves. [General Kargath](../Characters/General Kargath.md) represents model he aspires toward: [orcish](../Races/Orcs.md) heritage fully integrated within meritocratic structures.

## Chess & Hybrid Tactics

Hector plays pragmatic aggressive chess—openings like Modern Defense combining solid structure with tactical opportunities. His style adapts between direct attacks when opponents show defensive weakness and strategic maneuvering when tactical approaches prove insufficient. Games feature flexible thinking: switching approaches based on concrete evaluation rather than predetermined style. This reflects his philosophy: practical effectiveness beats ideological consistency when circumstances reward adaptation.

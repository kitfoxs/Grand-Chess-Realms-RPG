# Artificer Duncan

## Title
Master Artificer of the Frontier

## Faction
Neutral

## Race
Human, Age 39

## Elo Rating
1400 - Competent amateur with methodical approach

## Description

Duncan operates workshop near [Knightfall City](../Geography/Knightfall City.md), his neutral location enabling commissions from both kingdoms while maintaining independence that institutional affiliations would compromise. Born into blacksmith family, he diverged from traditional metalwork after witnessing magical artifact demonstration during childhood—experience revealing possibilities beyond conventional craftsmanship that technical skill alone cannot achieve. Apprenticeship with [dwarven](../Races/Dwarves.md) artificer taught him combining metallurgical precision with enchantment theory, producing devices integrating mechanical and mystical components into functional innovations that neither discipline achieves independently.

His creations include precision timepieces maintaining accuracy through magical stabilization, communication devices enabling long-distance messaging without requiring trained mages, and specialized chess sets where pieces move according to notation input—practical inventions serving commercial markets rather than purely theoretical research that academic institutions pursue. Both [White Kingdom](../Factions/White Kingdom.md) and [Black Kingdom](../Factions/Black Kingdom.md) occasionally commission military applications—enhanced armor incorporating protective wards, weapons whose enchantments complement physical properties—yet Duncan refuses projects whose primary purpose involves maximizing destructive capability rather than solving legitimate defensive needs.

## Chess & Engineering Philosophy

Duncan's chess reflects his methodical engineering approach—he plays solid systems like the Colle opening, emphasizing reliable development and clear plans over tactical complications. Games feature patient maneuvering, careful calculation preventing blunders, and practical technique converting advantages through straightforward methods. This mirrors his crafting philosophy: elegant simplicity beats unnecessary complexity when functionality determines success.

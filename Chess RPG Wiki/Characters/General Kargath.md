## Complete Backstory

Born to orcish tribe in territories bordering [Black Kingdom](../Factions/Black Kingdom.md), Kargath grew up during period when Emperor Marius II was implementing reforms integrating non-human populations into empire.

He advanced steadily—corporal at twenty-one, sergeant at twenty-four, lieutenant at twenty-seven. Each promotion came through demonstrated competence in campaigns against border threats and during conflicts with [White Kingdom](../Factions/White Kingdom.md). [Emperor Darius](Emperor Darius Blackbourne.md), newly ascended to throne and seeking to prove meritocratic reforms worked for all capable individuals regardless of species, identified Kargath as exactly the type of officer the reformed empire needed. He promoted Kargath to General at thirty-two, assigning him command of Northern Frontier where his combination of orcish toughness and imperial training proved ideal for harsh conditions and regular threats.

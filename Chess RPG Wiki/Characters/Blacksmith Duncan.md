## Description

Duncan represents generations of blacksmithing tradition—family craft passed from father to son across centuries, techniques refined through accumulated experience that formal training cannot replicate. His forge located in frontier village serves both [White Kingdom](../Factions/White Kingdom.md) and [Black Kingdom](../Factions/Black Kingdom.md) customers, neutral stance enabling business relationships that partisan allegiance would prevent. Unlike [Artificer Duncan](../Characters/Artificer Duncan.md) who blends magic with metalwork, Blacksmith Duncan practices traditional methods—heating, hammering, tempering through craftsmanship requiring no mystical enhancement beyond skill earned through decades at anvil.

His reputation derives from reliability rather than innovation—weapons maintain edges through hard campaigns, armor provides dependable protection, and horseshoes last through rough terrain. Both kingdoms' military quartermasters occasionally commission bulk orders when frontier operations require local sourcing, his output lacking prestigious reputation that royal armories command yet providing functional equipment that soldiers trust. Duncan refuses creating specialized torture implements or ceremonial weapons whose primary purpose involves displaying wealth rather than practical utility, recognizing that some commissions compromise integrity regardless of payment offered.

## Chess & Craftsman's Patience

Duncan plays straightforward chess—simple openings like the Italian Game, solid development, avoiding complications beyond his analytical comfort zone. Games feature practical piece placement and basic tactical awareness, reflecting his crafting philosophy: competent execution of proven methods beats ambitious innovations risking catastrophic failure. He plays occasionally at village tavern, socializing over boards rather than pursuing competitive improvement.

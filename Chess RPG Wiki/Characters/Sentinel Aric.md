# Sentinel Aric

## Title
Guardian of the Realm

## Faction
[White Kingdom](../Factions/White Kingdom.md)

## Race
Human, Age 43

## Elo Rating
1500 - Solid amateur with defensive mindset

## Description

Sentinel Aric commands border guard units maintaining [White Kingdom's](../Factions/White Kingdom.md) defensive perimeter—prestigious position requiring both combat competence and leadership capability coordinating patrols across contested territories. Note that Sentinel Aric differs from [Scout Aric](../Characters/Scout Aric.md)—shared first name occasionally generating confusion that distinct titles ("Sentinel" versus "Scout") clarify, both serving defense through different roles (Sentinel commanding units versus Scout conducting reconnaissance). Born into knightly family, he received traditional martial training yet specialized toward defensive operations rather than offensive campaigns, recognizing that protecting borders requires different expertise than battlefield charges.

His responsibilities include organizing patrol rotations maintaining constant surveillance, responding to incursions before penetrating interior territories, and coordinating with scouts including [Scout Aric](../Characters/Scout Aric.md) and rangers like [Ranger Quinn](../Characters/Ranger Quinn.md) whose intelligence informs defensive deployments. [Captain Thorne](../Characters/Captain Thorne.md) represents different command specialization focusing on logistics versus Sentinel Aric's operational border security. His leadership philosophy emphasizes reliability over brilliance: consistent competent execution preventing infiltrations matters more than spectacular victories when defensive success means nothing notable occurs because threats got interdicted before manifesting.

## Chess & Defensive Philosophy

Sentinel Aric plays solid defensive chess—systems like French Defense emphasizing resilient structures and counterattacking opportunities. His style features prophylactic moves preventing opponent tactics, patient defense absorbing pressure, and willingness maintaining draws when defensive objectives achieve without requiring winning. Games reflect sentinel philosophy: preventing opponent success matters more than achieving spectacular victories when security determines outcomes. This mirrors defensive operations: successful border protection means threats get stopped before becoming problems.

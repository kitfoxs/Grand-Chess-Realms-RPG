The Wandering Trader

## Faction
Neutral

## Race
Human, Age 49

## Elo Rating
1200 - Casual player with practical instincts

## Description

Merchant Tobias built trading network spanning both kingdoms through decades of traveling commerce—relationships with suppliers, knowledge of market conditions, and reputation for reliable dealing that partisan merchants confined to single kingdom cannot replicate. His neutral stance enables crossing borders that factional allegiance would close, accessing goods that domestic markets lack, and providing information channels that official diplomacy cannot accommodate. Unlike [Cleric Tobias](../Characters/Cleric Tobias.md) whose wandering serves spiritual ministry, Merchant Tobias pursues commercial opportunities while maintaining independence that institutional employment would compromise.

His contacts include farmers producing specialized crops, artisans crafting unique goods, and underground networks moving merchandise that legal channels restrict. This diversity enables sourcing rare items that wealthy patrons commission—[Countess Liora](../Characters/Countess Liora.md) occasionally requests ancient texts for her library, [Artificer Duncan](../Characters/Artificer Duncan.md) seeks exotic materials for specialized creations, and both kingdoms' agents discreetly purchase supplies whose procurement official channels cannot acknowledge. Yet Tobias maintains ethical boundaries: refusing contracts facilitating genuine harm despite profit potential, recognizing that reputation matters more than individual transactions when long-term success requires trust.

## Chess & Practical Trading

Merchant Tobias plays straightforward practical chess—simple openings avoiding theoretical complexity, solid development, and willingness accepting draws when forcing wins risks losing. His games feature basic tactical awareness and practical piece placement, reflecting commercial philosophy: reliable competence beats ambitious risk when steady profits matter more than spectacular gains. He plays casually at taverns, socializing and gathering information through relaxed conversations.

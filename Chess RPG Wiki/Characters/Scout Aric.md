## Title
Pathfinder of the Wilds

## Faction
[White Kingdom](../Factions/White Kingdom.md)

## Race
Human, Age 29

## Elo Rating
1400 - Competent amateur with practical instincts

## Description

Scout Aric specializes in reconnaissance and wilderness navigation—frontier village upbringing developing intimate familiarity with terrain, tracking skills, and survival expertise that urban training cannot replicate. Note that Scout Aric differs from [Sentinel Aric](../Characters/Sentinel Aric.md)—shared first name occasionally generating confusion that distinct roles ("Scout" versus "Sentinel") clarify, both serving [White Kingdom](../Factions/White Kingdom.md) defense through different specializations. His responsibilities involve advanced scouting identifying [Black Kingdom](../Factions/Black Kingdom.md) movements, mapping unfamiliar territories that military operations require understanding, and providing early warning when enemy activities suggest impending threats.

Unlike [Ranger Quinn](../Characters/Ranger Quinn.md) whose [elven](../Races/Elves.md) longevity enables decades refining capabilities, Scout Aric relies on human adaptability and practical problem-solving developed through necessity rather than extended refinement. He operates as part of military structure rather than independently, reporting through [Captain Thorne](../Characters/Captain Thorne.md) who coordinates tactical intelligence into operational understanding. His effectiveness derives from straightforward competence: reliable performance executing assigned missions without requiring elaborate support, providing information commanders need without embellishment that clarity would complicate. Village origin maintains connection to common populations whose defense motivates service beyond merely professional duty.

## Chess & Practical Scouting

Scout Aric plays practical straightforward chess—openings like London System emphasizing solid development and clear plans. His style features avoiding unnecessary complications, preferring positions where concrete evaluation determines outcomes, and willingness accepting draws when forcing wins risks losing. Games reflect scouting philosophy: gather accurate information efficiently beats elaborate analysis when timely reporting matters. This mirrors operational approach: reliable competence beats exceptional brilliance when consistency determines mission success.

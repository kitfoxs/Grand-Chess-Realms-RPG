Master of Forbidden Summonings

## Faction
[Black Kingdom](../Factions/Black Kingdom.md)

## Race
Human, Age 51

## Elo Rating
1750 - Strong player with aggressive complexity

## Description

Invoker Thorne's exile from [White Kingdom](../Factions/White Kingdom.md) resulted from pursuing summoning research that orthodox doctrine classified as forbidden—investigations into darker entities whose power tempts practitioners yet whose control demands constant vigilance preventing catastrophic failures. His argument that understanding threats requires studying them convinced [White Kingdom](../Factions/White Kingdom.md) authorities less than concerns about whether theoretical research inevitably progresses toward practical application whose consequences theological principles cannot permit risking. [Black Kingdom](../Factions/Black Kingdom.md) welcomed his expertise, institutional culture celebrating innovation over cautious restriction.

Decades serving [Black Kingdom's](../Factions/Black Kingdom.md) arcane council refined capabilities into formidable arsenal—summoning entities that battlefield deployment provides tactical advantages, binding powerful creatures whose cooperation formal alliances cannot achieve, and invoking forces that ethical constraints prevent [White Kingdom](../Factions/White Kingdom.md) accessing. Yet [Emperor Darius Blackbourne's](../Characters/Emperor Darius Blackbourne.md) growing philosophical doubts about whether pragmatic advantages justify moral costs create uncertainty about future policies: whether Thorne's contributions continue receiving institutional support or whether ethical reevaluations limit previously tolerated methods. [Master Garron](../Characters/Master Garron.md) represents potential competitor whose necromantic specialization overlaps Thorne's summoning expertise.

## Chess & Summoning Complexity

Invoker Thorne plays aggressive complex chess—sharp openings like Dragon Sicilian generating tactical complications. His style features calculated risks, sacrifices for initiative, and positions where multiple threats operate simultaneously forcing opponents into defensive passivity. Games emphasize dynamic complexity: maintaining pressure through interconnected threats beats static advantages when opponent mistakes multiply under sustained pressure. This mirrors summoning philosophy: coordinating multiple dangerous forces beats single powerful entity when complexity prevents effective counter-measures.

# Ancient Relics

## The First Board

The First Board represents legendary artifact said to be original chessboard that gods gifted to mortal kings during mythic age when divine and material realms maintained closer connection than current separation permits. Composed of marble and onyx—white and black in purest forms—the board supposedly possesses magical properties enabling it to replay legendary matches from history, displaying pieces moving autonomously across squares recreating games whose outcomes shaped civilizations' trajectories. According to prophecy, when world's final confrontation approaches, pieces will arrange themselves without external manipulation, revealing position that foretells whether kingdoms achieve reconciliation, one triumphs decisively, or mutual destruction occurs that neither side survives.

Physical location remains unknown—various theories suggest it rests in hidden chamber beneath [Tower of Balance](../Geography/The Tower of Balance.md), lies concealed in vault at [Night's Basilica](../Geography/Night_s Basilica.md), or awaits discovery in unexplored ruins that [Dragon's Sicilian Range](../Geography/Dragon_s Sicilian Range.md) or [Rook Mountains](../Geography/Rook Mountains.md) conceal. [The Midnight Crown](../Secret Organizations/The Midnight Crown.md) dedicates substantial resources seeking First Board, believing that controlling artifact grants ability to understand or potentially influence cosmic chess match that mortal fates supposedly reflect. Skeptics dismiss entire legend as pious fiction—later invention attributed to mythic origins for lending theological weight to chess's cultural significance that prosaic historical development cannot match.

[The Grand Tournament of Sages](../Historical Events/The Grand Tournament of Sages.md) winner reportedly received blessing of Caissa and right to claim artifact from First Board—suggesting legendary object actually exists in accessible location rather than remaining purely mythological. Whether [Lady Isolde](../Characters/Lady Isolde.md) obtained actual relic or merely symbolic representation remains ambiguous—her typical discretion about personal affairs prevents confirmation, while inquiries encounter evasive responses that neither confirm nor deny possession.

## The Eight Stones

The Eight Stones comprise set of enchanted chess pieces—one of each type (king, queen, bishop, knight, rook, pawn) plus two additional significant pieces—scattered across realms as sacred relics whose individual powers supposedly relate to their chess roles while collective reunion allegedly grants unprecedented capabilities. Each stone reportedly bestows blessing aligned with piece type: the Rook Stone provides protection to fortresses and strongholds, Knight Stone grants courage and tactical inspiration to warriors, Bishop Stone enhances wisdom and indirect magical influence, Queen Stone amplifies creative power and transformative capabilities, King Stone confers leadership authority and strategic understanding, while Pawn Stones enable transformation and hidden potential's realization.

Legends describing Stones' origins vary dramatically: some accounts claim gods distributed pieces to worthy mortals during mythic age, others suggest ancient civilization created them through magical processes modern knowledge cannot replicate, while alternative theories propose that dragon Crimson Sage at [Dragon's Sicilian Range](../Geography/Dragon_s Sicilian Range.md) crafted them millennia ago as experiment exploring chess principles' metaphysical significance. Regardless of origins, contemporary searches focus on locating scattered pieces: various factions including both kingdoms' governments, [The Midnight Crown](../Secret Organizations/The Midnight Crown.md), and independent adventurers pursue Stones believing their power could shift strategic balance decisively.

Some Stones' locations remain documented through historical records: one reportedly resides in [Onyx Citadel's](../Geography/Onyx Citadel.md) treasury, another allegedly rests in [Hermitage of the Knight](../Geography/Hermitage of the Knight.md) where training masters employ it enhancing martial instruction, while third supposedly lies concealed in [Cave of Shadows](../Geography/Cave of Shadows.md) where mystical properties align with location's unusual metaphysical characteristics. Others remain lost—potentially destroyed, hidden in unexplored territories, or held by collectors whose discretion prevents public knowledge of possession.

The prophecy that reuniting all Eight Stones enables mortal challenging god at chess for world's fate creates ultimate quest narrative—yet whether literal truth or metaphorical expression of how mastering strategic principles grants power affecting historical trajectories remains philosophically contested. [Grandmaster Rionn](../Characters/Grandmaster Rionn.md) suggests that "challenging god at chess" might represent achieving sufficient strategic understanding that one's decisions shape civilization's course—power that anyone demonstrating genuine mastery could theoretically wield regardless of whether magical artifacts facilitate the process.

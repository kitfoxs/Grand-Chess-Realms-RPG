## üìù How the AI Learns

### 1. During Conversation

The AI automatically extracts information when you chat:

```

AI: [learns name: Alex, fact: lives in Seattle]

You: "I love the King's Gambit!"
AI: [learns chess preference: King's Gambit]

You: "I work as a software engineer"
AI: [learns personal fact: software engineer]
```

**Triggers for Learning:**
- Name: "My name is...", "I'm...", "Call me..."
- Location: "I live in...", "I'm from..."
- Work/Study: "I work...", "I study..."
- Preferences: "I love...", "I like...", "I prefer..."
- Favorites: "My favorite opening is..."

### 2. From Your Play

The AI observes your moves and learns:

```
Strong tactical move ‚Üí "Shows tactical awareness"
Endgame technique ‚Üí "Strong endgame play"
Blunder ‚Üí "Missed tactic at move 15"
Aggressive play ‚Üí "Aggressive playing style"
```

**What It Notices:**
- **Move Quality**: Brilliant moves, good moves, mistakes, blunders
- **Tactical Awareness**: Spotting combinations
- **Positional Understanding**: Strategic play
- **Opening Knowledge**: What you play and how well
- **Endgame Skill**: Technical proficiency
- **Time Management**: How you handle time pressure

### 3. Relationship Building

The AI tracks your developing friendship:

```
First game ‚Üí Friendship Level: 1
5 games ‚Üí Friendship Level: 3
Good conversations ‚Üí +0.2 per session
Long game ‚Üí +0.1
Completing game ‚Üí +0.5
```

### 4. Emotional Awareness

```
You: "That was an amazing game!"
AI: [memorable moment recorded]

You: "Haha that was funny!"
AI: [potential inside joke]

You express frustration ‚Üí AI adjusts sensitivity
You celebrate victory ‚Üí AI remembers your joy
```

## üéØ How Memory Affects Gameplay

### Game Start

**Without Memory:**
```
AI: "Hello! Ready for a game?"
```

**With Memory:**
```
AI: "Hey Alex! Nice to see you again! Last time you 
     crushed me with that King's Gambit. Ready for 
     a rematch? üòä"
```

### During Play

**Without Memory:**
```
You: "What should I do here?"
AI: "Consider developing your pieces."
```

**With Memory:**
```
You: "What should I do here?"
AI: "Given your aggressive style, you might like 
     f4 to open lines. Remember that King's Gambit 
     spirit! Though you could also develop calmly 
     with Nf3."
```

### Game End

**Without Memory:**
```
AI: "Good game!"
```

**With Memory:**
```
AI: "Great game, Alex! That's your 5th win in a row 
     - you're really improving! Your tactical vision 
     is getting scary good. Want to try a different 
     opening next time, or stick with the King's 
     Gambit you love?"
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Managing Memory

### Viewing Stats

```python
from memory_manager import MemoryManager

memory = MemoryManager()
stats = memory.get_stats_summary()

print(f"Games: {stats['games_played']}")
print(f"Record: {stats['record']}")
print(f"Friendship: {stats['friendship_level']}/10")
```

### Updating Preferences

```python
# User wants less banter
memory.update_preferences(
    likes_banter=False,
    sensitivity_level='high'
)

# User wants more help
memory.update_preferences(
    wants_hints=True,
    prefers_explanations=True
)
```

### Adding Information Manually

```python
# Set name
memory.update_player_name("Alex")

# Add personal fact
memory.learn_personal_fact("Learning chess for 2 years")

# Record memorable moment
memory.add_memorable_moment("Perfect endgame technique")

# Add inside joke
memory.add_inside_joke("Always plays the most aggressive move")
```

### Exporting/Importing

```python
# Export memory
memory.export_memory("my_chess_memory.json")

# Import memory (e.g., on new computer)
memory.import_memory("my_chess_memory.json")

# Reset everything
memory.reset_memory()
```

# Track what areas need work
weak_areas = analyze_game_history()

if "endgame" in weak_areas:
    focus_endgame_teaching()
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Memory Not Loading

```bash
# Check if file exists
ls ~/.config/cli-chess/memory/player_memory.json

# View contents
cat ~/.config/cli-chess/memory/player_memory.json

# Check permissions
chmod 644 ~/.config/cli-chess/memory/player_memory.json
```

### Corrupted Memory

```bash
# Backup first
cp ~/.config/cli-chess/memory/player_memory.json ~/backup.json

# Reset memory
python memory_viewer.py --interactive
# Choose option 4 to reset
```

### AI Not Remembering

Check that:
1. Memory file exists and is writable
2. MemoryManager is passed to chat client
3. Games are completing properly
4. No errors in logs

```

### Game 25
```
AI: "Alex, my friend! It's been almost a week! I 
     missed our games. Remember that crazy queen 
     sacrifice last time? Ready to top that? üòÑ"
You: "Haha yes! Let's do this!"
AI: "Your move, champ. And this time I won't fall 
     for your King's Gambit tricks... maybe. üòâ"
```
